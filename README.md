# VisaChecker
Check if you require a visa to go to your dream vacation spot! 

My wife and I love exploring new places across the world, this summer we wanted to book a trip to Italy but soon found out that my wife would not be able to make the trip since Indian citizens would require a visa to go to Italy. 
However for the last trip we went to Costa Rica and she would need a visa to go there too but since she has her US Green card she could visit for a period of 30 days! This led us down a rabbit hole of figuring out a good country to visit that would let her visit without applying for a visa and waiting for an interview, thus came up with this idea!

Right now this is in early development stages and uses a simple ChatGPT promt to check if someone would require a visa to go from their home airport to their destination (including any layovers), once I figure out a good source to get each country's data directly from the embassy I will incorporate those APIs into this very quick and simple project!
